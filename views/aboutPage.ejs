        <h2>About The Forge</h2>
        <p>
            The Forge is built on the belief that we are each a mosaic of experiences—shards of memory, emotion, and insight. Alone, these fragments may seem sharp or incomplete, but when brought together in the heat of reflection, they fuse into something strong, clear, and beautiful.
        </p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                True self-discovery is a process of gathering, melting, and blending the many facets of who we are. In The Forge, you are both the artisan and the glass: you choose which shards to cast, which colors to blend, and how to shape your evolving whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this fusion, the boundaries between your fragments dissolve. What was once scattered becomes seamless—a singular, luminous self forged from the fires of experience.

            <h2>Why Glass?</h2>
            <p>
                Glass is both fragile and enduring, transparent yet mysterious. It reminds us that transformation requires both vulnerability and strength. In The Forge, your journey is honored in every reflection, every glow, and every new form your story takes.
