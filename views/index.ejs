        <h2>Welcome to The Forge</h2>
        <p>
            Step into The Forge, where your inner world is molten glass—fluid, luminous, and ready to be shaped. Here, every thought and feeling is a shard, waiting to be gathered, refined, and fused into something greater.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you explore, you’ll cast your fragments into the fire, watching them soften, glow, and transform. Through reflection and creation, you’ll discover the beauty in your own complexity and the power of forging a seamless self from scattered pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Forge is not just a place, but a journey—one of self-discovery, transformation, and unity. Shape your shards, blend your colors, and let your story emerge in glass.
