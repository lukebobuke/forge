Thesis

Understanding of self begins from scattered fragments. Sharp, shallow reflections. However, through an intensity and focus of inner illumination, these pieces fuse into an annealed, seamless whole that transcends all separable shards.
Narrative

At first glance, we appear as a scatter of facets: trinkets glinting with the light of memory and feeling, each one seemingly distinct and touchable. Like fragments on a workbench, they can be held up, examined, admired. But alone, they remain brittle reflections, partial truths that shimmer but do not endure, to be merely glanced at but never gazed upon.

When swept into the furnace of introspection, the facets begin to soften at their edges. Colors bleed and cracks melt away, and the pieces interact as their borders dissolve. They refract and shape each other's internal tensions, forging new and unexpected contours and hues. Another shard introduced doesnâ€™t merely add, it shifts the flow of the entire molten pool, altering the emergent whole in ways that cannot be untangled.

The form crystalizes. The scattered, splintered self becomes an annealed, indivisible sculpture, and in this state, no single facet can be teased apart without destroying the integrity of the whole. There exists now a lens through which one perceives oneself and the world with a depth and clarity impossible when clinging to individual pieces.
