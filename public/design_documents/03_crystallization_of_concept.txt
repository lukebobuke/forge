Pages

    Login page

    Create user (sign-up) page

    Home page for visitors who arenâ€™t logged in

    Landing page after user logs in

    Shard definition page (user form for text, tint, glow)

    Final sculpture viewing page (view generated 3D model, analysis, download options)

Core System & Data Backbone

    Create routes, controllers, and models for shards

    Design shard schema: text, tint, glow, timestamps, user association

    Facet (shard) data generates prompt for 3D model AI

    Backend logic to lock shards after creation (annealed state)

Design Language & Visual Framework

    Implement shard aesthetic framework: tint, reflection, glow logic

    Recessed button components with engraved text and depth behavior

    Embossed headers

    Overlapping panes or shard scattering visuals

    Thicker vs thinner shard cues for permanence vs ephemerality

    Hover-based wipes

    Hover reflections (anime flicker)

    Webcam face reflection overlay into glass elements

    Tint personalization during onboarding

3D Model & Sculpture Generation

    Develop logic to generate prompt from shard data for 3D model AI

    Display returned 3D sculpture on final viewing page

    Create analysis messaging describing conceptual/emotional sculpture themes

    Enable sculpture download as 3D-printable file

Strict MVP Path

If focusing strictly on core expression:

    Shard creation (text, tint, glow)

    Backend to store and lock shards

    Generation of AI 3D sculpture prompt

    Sculpture viewing page (final integrated form)

    Basic shard aesthetic and minimal design language
