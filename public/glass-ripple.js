// write me some css or javascript to make glassmorphism more realistic. here's my idea: using a black and white image of a rippled glass texture, use the values in the image to displace whatever is on screen beneath that element, making it appear as though the light is bending through glass. the glass should simply look rippled as it does in the background_glass1 image. the effect should apply behind any elements that are glass. use the background_glass1 file for this. edit any files in this directory needed to make this work. make sure html2canvas is included in the html.
